# **Background** 

As a data analyst at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, I am responsible for this case study. The Cyclistic bicycle fleet has grown to 5,824 bicycles that are geotracking and locked into 692 stations across Chicago since its inception in 2016. It is possible to unlock the bikes at any station and return them to any other station within the system at any time.

The pricing plans offered by Cyclistic are three: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. A casual rider is a customer who purchases a single-ride or full-day pass. A Cyclistic member is someone who purchases an annual membership.

A new marketing strategy is being developed by the company to convert casual riders into annual members in order to increase revenue. In order to develop a data-driven marketing strategy, I will analyze bike usage data to determine how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

# **ASK stage**

**Business Task**</br>
Cyclistic bicycle membership differs from occasional use, and how occasional riders get influenced to join. This study aims to understand the differences and influence of annual members.

# **PREPARE Stage**

[Here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) is a public dataset that I will use. Motivate International Inc. has made the data available under this license.Â Public datasets do not contain personal information, so it is not possible to determine how often a rider uses the same service. </br>
The data used covers the last twelve months, namely from December 2021 to November 2022. During the preparation of the data for subsequent analysis, each data file was examined for integrity, duplicate entries were identified, and whether they were correctly written. In addition, they were examined to see if there were any missing values, and for this reason the start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, and end_station_id columns were removed.

# **PROCESS Stage**

For this stage, we created two new columns in each file to keep track of how long each user had the bike. Ride_length was the name of this column. On the other hand, the second column determined when each ride began based on the day of the week. </br>
On examination of the ride_length column before the main analysis, 74 rows were deleted for being invalid.
