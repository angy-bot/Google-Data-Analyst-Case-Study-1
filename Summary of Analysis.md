** Background ** 

As a data analyst at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, I am responsible for this case study. The Cyclistic bicycle fleet has grown to 5,824 bicycles that are geotracking and locked into 692 stations across Chicago since its inception in 2016. It is possible to unlock the bikes at any station and return them to any other station within the system at any time.
The pricing plans offered by Cyclistic are three: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. A casual rider is a customer who purchases a single-ride or full-day pass. A Cyclistic member is someone who purchases an annual membership.
A new marketing strategy is being developed by the company to convert casual riders into annual members in order to increase revenue. In order to develop a data-driven marketing strategy, I will analyze bike usage data to determine how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
